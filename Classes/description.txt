[quote=About this mod]Did you recognize it? Yep, that's the Excaligoat power ^^ But the wonderful power of this sword had one major fault: It was completely impossible to make it go in the direction you want it to go X)
So that's why I came with this mod: I turned the random explosive sword into a controllable explosive engine :p Nothing hard to code that, I just changed the direction  where you are projected to be aligned with the camera.
